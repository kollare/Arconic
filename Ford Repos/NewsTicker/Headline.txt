More updates to follow. “Opened in 2000, the $100 million Driveability Test Facility is a one of a kind test facility able to replicate the conditions of any altitude or climate in the world, from the highest peaks to the deepest valleys, from hurricane-force gales to early morning tranquility. The six tunnel complex was constructed by Sverdrup Technology Inc. and is leased by Ford. It is used exclusively by Ford Motor Co. engineers. The Allen Park test facility cuts in half Ford's need for on-road evaluations in hot and cold climates. The road tests are conducted merely to confirm lab results. The new facility allows Ford to shave 13 months from the 36- to 40-month vehicle development cycle. The 120,000-sq.-ft. (11,000-sq.-m) complex subjects vehicles to temperatures from -40F to 130F (-40C to 54C), winds of more than 150 mph (240 km/h) and altitudes ranging from 280 ft. (85 m) below sea level to more than 12,000 ft. (3,600 m) above sea level.”
